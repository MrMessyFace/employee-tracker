# Employee Tracker

## Description

I was tasked with creating a Node.js database app that uses inquiries to help the user search the database for a company. I chose to use WWE and real people as the employees by accessing the list published [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WWE_personnel).

## Installation

I used Node.js, Inquirer, MySQL2, and Express.js.

## Usage

When using "npm start" to start the app, it asks a series of questions that the answers will determine which part of the database you can access with multiple ways to see in different aspects and ways to sort the data. You can also add a new employee, update an existing one, and remove an employee.
